# irt-ktane-mods
 Mods for the game _Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes_. Each trial consists of one specific configuration for the game's puzzles, such that each trial is kept consistent across experiments. There are three main puzzle types:
-   **Wires**: The player with the manual will tell the player with the bomb which wires to cut
-   **Colored Buttons**: The player with the manual will tell the player with the bomb which colored buttons to press
-   **Keypad**: The player with the bomb describes the word displayed on the puzzle, and the player with the manual describes the sequence of buttons to press

Each trial features these three puzzles, and they get progressively more complex, such that the players will need to communicate more for the purposes of the experiment.

# Usage
In order to use these mods, you will need:
- Steam, to run the game
- The game, Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, on PC

Here are instructions to run the mods:
- Download the trial folders that you are interested in
- Open the File Explorer or Finder, and navigate to Applications > Steam > Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes
- If it does not already exist, create a new folder titled "mods"
- Move the trials into that folder
- Boot the game up and turn on the Mods option when prompted by the game

Some additional mods were necessary, and are available to download from the Steam Workshop for Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, including:
- **Tweaks**: Allows you to set a seed such that the location of the puzzles is not randomized for each game
- **BombCreator**: Allows you to keep random events (such as the lights turning off in-game) from happening
